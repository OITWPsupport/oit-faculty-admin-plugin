OIT Faculty Admin - Changelog

==== Version 1.1.20 - 8/18/16 ====
Auto update test.

==== Version 1.1.19 - 8/18/16 ====
Auto update test.

==== Version 1.1.18 - 8/18/16 ====
Bringing in auto-update logic. The auto-update code present in previous version is non-
functional. This will use the same updater.php mechanism used in our other plugins.

==== Version 1.1.17 - 8/11/16 ====
- Previous version broke the admin's ability to add personnel to groups. This restores that 
(although it probably reintroduces the accessibility error we aimed to fix in 1.1.12-1.1.16)
(Change is in includes/ofaTheme.php)

==== Version 1.1.16 - 8/1/16 ====
- Call to get_blog_details() restored. (See below). Commenting this out wasn't tested--
it fixed one problem but caused a new one: profile pages on subsites stopped working. 
Restoring this addresses IR711454, IR711535.

==== Version 1.1.12 - 7/15/16 ====
- PHP 5.4 and above no longer support Call-time pass-by-reference;
modifying includes/helpers/ofaGroupWidget.php to use ksort($groupNames) instead of 
ksort(&$groupNames).
- Logs are showing "Call to undefined function get_blog_details()" in 
includes/ofaDefinitions.php so we're returning an empty array in getCurrentSite rather 
than a call to get_blog_details.
- Updates personnel.php and course.php so the text of the "Syllabus" link now reads 
"[course] [course number] syllabus" to avoid the non-distinguishable link errors found by 
Siteimprove accessibility scanner
