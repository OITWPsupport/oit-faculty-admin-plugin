OIT Faculty Admin - Changelog

==== Version 1.1.12 - 7/15/16 ====
- PHP 5.4 and above no longer support Call-time pass-by-reference;
modifying includes/helpers/ofaGroupWidget.php to use ksort($groupNames) instead of 
ksort(&$groupNames).
- Logs are showing "Call to undefined function get_blog_details()" in 
includes/ofaDefinitions.php so we're returning an empty array in getCurrentSite rather 
than a call to get_blog_details.
- Updates personnel.php and course.php so the text of the "Syllabus" link now reads 
"[course] [course number] syllabus" to avoid the non-distinguishable link errors found by 
Siteimprove accessibility scanner
